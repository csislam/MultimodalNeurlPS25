# MultimodalNeurlPS25
Developed a reproducible multimodal learning framework combining ResNet50 image and BERT text encoders with attention-based fusion. Includes conditional attention WGAN with gradient penalty &amp; bias regularization, explainability via Grad-CAM++ and LIME, Reveal-to-Revise bias feedback, and evaluation scripts (accuracy, F1, SSIM, FID, bias).
